# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I actively support and patch the latest version of this plugin. Older versions may not receive security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 1.0.x   | âœ… Yes              |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue, please report it **privately**.

### ðŸ“¬ How to report:
- Open a **GitHub issue** with the title prefixed by `[Security]`
- Do **not** disclose sensitive information in the issue itself
- I will follow up with a private channel for details

I aim to respond within **72 hours**. Once verified, I will resolve the issue and publish a fix as quickly as possible.

## Disclosure Process

I follow responsible disclosure best practices:
- You report it privately
- I assess and validate
- A fix is developed and released
- Public disclosure happens after the patch

Thank you for helping me make Simple Debugging more secure!
